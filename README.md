**Project Description**
<br /><br />
The proposed system will be video walls to replace the old 70s looking publications displays in Life Science and Physical Science. The system will be a large touch screen or a combination of multiple screens that work together to allow students the ability to interact with the information that is displayed on the screens at the moment. For instance, there could be a rotating display of faculty and staff. If a student touches one of the faculty or staff members, their bio and a blurb regarding their recent research would appear on screen. Then the board could rotate to the disciplines and a student could touch one of those. Once a student touches a disciple, the screen(s) would show more information about that discipline, career opportunities, types of degrees offered, etc. If the system ends up being a video wall with multiple screens instead of just one huge screen, the project would be how to get these screens functioning properly together and how to display the information amongst multiple boards.  

The ultimate goal of the proposed system is to modernize the NATS halls and bring them up to date with the 21stâ€¯century. Our capstone team would need to creatively problem solve through cost estimating an entire package from hardware and possibly software. In addition, we would need to train the administration of this project and other faculty on how to use the system and update the software.
